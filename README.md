# Luis Command-line Interface

Simple command-line interface to interact with Microsoft LUIS APIs.

## Usage

This CLI uses LUIS APIs to automate following tasks:
* export an existing LUIS app to the specified local json file.
* create (import) a new LUIS app from a local json file.
* update the utterances (or examples) of an existing LUIS App as specified in a local json file.

Note:
* This tool assumes the use of "native LUIS app json files", the ones you get when you export an app. You must follow that schema.
* For the moment, when updating, it only considers utterances. It modifies existing ones, creates new ones and removes obsolete ones as needed.
* App update also automatically triggers training and app publishment.
