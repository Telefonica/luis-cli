# Luis Command-line Interface

Simple command-line interface to interact with Microsoft LUIS APIs.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install -g @telefonica/luis-cli
```

## Usage

This CLI uses the LUIS API to automate the following tasks:
* update an existing LUIS app with the model of a local json file.
* export an existing LUIS app to the specified local json file.

Notes:
* This tool assumes the use of "native LUIS app json files", the ones you get when you export an app.
* When updating, it update utterances, intents, entities and phrase lists, creating the new ones and
  deleting the ones no longer used. It also train an publish the app.

Type `./bin/luis-cli -h` to get more info about the available commands and general options.
To know more about one command, type `./bin/luis-cli <command> -h`.

For example: to update, to train and to publish a concrete LUIS application version based on a new LUIS model:
`./bin/luis-cli update -s aac4012305e94ffebe2fa8408954aab3 -a b073cd3d-3b86-4367-813a-638840c83e3c -m ./training_model.json -v 0.3 -r westus -t false`

Or to test a model:
`./bin/luis-cli test -s aac4012305e94ffebe2fa8408954aab3 -a b073cd3d-3b86-4367-813a-638840c83e3c -m ./training_model.json -e ./errors.json -q 3`
